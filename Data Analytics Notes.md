TYPES OF ANALYSIS
1. Descriptive Analysis - relies on historical data to generate report. Eg. how much did product X were sold in Q3 last year?
2. Predictive Analysis - uses real time and/or historical data to make predictions based on probability. It is important to ask forward-thinking questions eg how much can product X sell next year?
3. Prescriptive Analysis - builds on #1 & #2 by recommending courses of action based on available data. Simplest example is...WAZE!
4. Diagnostic Analysis - enhances #1 by digging deeper to uncover anomalies
